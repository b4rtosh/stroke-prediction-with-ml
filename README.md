### üìã Coding Conventions

#### 1. Code Style
- Follow the [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guide for Python (or appropriate language-specific style guide)
- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces)
- Maintain clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Write meaningful comments and documentation


#### 2. Naming Conventions
- **Classes**: Use CamelCase (`MyClassName`)
- **Functions**: Use snake_case (`calculate_total_value()`)
- **Constants**: Use UPPERCASE with underscores (`MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`)
- **Variables**: Use descriptive, lowercase names with underscores (`user_authentication`)

### ü§ù Pull Request Guidelines

### Pull Request Workflow

1. **Branch Management**
   - Create a new branch for each feature or bugfix
   - Branch naming convention:
     - Feature: `feature/short-description`
     - Bugfix: `bugfix/issue-description`
     - Hotfix: `hotfix/critical-issue`

2. **Commit Best Practices**
   - Write clear, concise commit messages
   - Use imperative mood: "Add feature" instead of "Added feature"
   - Provide context about why the change was made


3. **Pull Request Template**
   ```markdown
   ## Description
   [Provide a clear summary of the changes]

   ## Type of Change
   - [ ] Bug fix
   - [ ] New feature
   - [ ] Breaking change
   - [ ] Documentation update

   ## Checklist
   - [ ] My code follows project style guidelines
   - [ ] I've performed a self-review of my code
   - [ ] I've added tests proving my fix/feature
   - [ ] Documentation is updated
   ```

### Review Process
1. Minimum of one code review required
2. Ensure no merge conflicts
4. Squash and merge for clean commit history


## üí° Best Practices
- Keep pull requests small and focused
- Address one concern per pull request
- Provide clear documentation for complex changes
- Refactor and improve code continuously

## üö® What to Avoid
- Do not commit directly to `main` or `master` branches
- Avoid large, monolithic pull requests
- Never commit sensitive information (passwords, keys)
- Do not bypass code review processes
